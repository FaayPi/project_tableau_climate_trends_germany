**Tableau Story:** [View the interactive report on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fee.pieper/viz/project_module4_tableau_climate_trends/Story)

## 🔎 Project Summary

This project explores long-term seasonal trends in **temperature and precipitation** across Germany from **1880 to 2024**. The analysis supports Germany’s national environmental program and feeds into **EU Climate Council** reporting.

Key questions:
- How have seasons changed across German regions?
- Where are the most significant warming and precipitation shifts?
- What might future climate patterns look like?

As a **Data Analyst**, I analyzed historical climate data across:
- **Seasons**: spring, summer, autumn, winter  
- **Regions**: German federal states  
- **Periods**: Climate Periods (IPCC) and decades
